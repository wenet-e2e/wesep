# Wesep

> We aim to build a toolkit focusing on front-end processing in the cocktail party set up, including target speaker extraction and ~~speech separation (Future work)~~


### Install for development & deployment
* Clone this repo
``` sh
https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wesep.git
```

* Create conda env: pytorch version >= 1.12.0 is required !!!
``` sh
conda create -n wesep python=3.9
conda activate wesep
conda install pytorch=1.12.1 torchaudio=0.12.1 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch -c conda-forge
pip install -r requirements.txt
pre-commit install  # for clean and tidy code
```

## The Target Speaker Extraction Task

> Target speaker extraction (TSE) focuses on isolating the speech of a specific target speaker from overlapped multi-talker speech, which is a typical setup in the cocktail party problem.
WeSep is featured with flexible target speaker modeling, scalable data management, effective on-the-fly data simulation, structured recipes and deployment support.

## Data Pipe Design

Following Wenet and Wespeaker, WeSep organizes the data processing modules as a pipeline of a set of different processors. The following figure shows such a pipeline with essential processors.
